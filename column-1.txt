A penny saved,
An ounce of prevention,
Early to bed and early to rise,
When in Rome,
Hope for the best,
Birds of a feather,
Donâ€™t count your chickens,
Curiosity killed,
A bad excuse,
A bad penny,
A bad workman,
A bird in the hand,
Better,
Clothes,
Criss-Cross,
Do not bite, 
Do not look,
Easier said,
Every dog,
Every Jack,
Fake it,
Fight fire,
Fortune favors,
Give a man a fish,
Teach a man to fish,
