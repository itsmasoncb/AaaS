a penny earned
worth a pound of cure
makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise
do as the Romans do
prepare for the worst
flock together
before they hatch
the cat
is better than none
always turns up
blames his tools
worth two in the bush
late than never 
make the man
applesauce
the hand that feeds you
a gift horse in the mouth
than done
has it's day
has his Jill
until you make it
with fire
the bold and the brave
feed him for a day
feed him for a lifetime
